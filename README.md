What is jelix-stylus-plugin ?
==============================

This project is a plugin for [Jelix](http://jelix.org) PHP framework. It allows you to use easily [stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) dynamic stylesheet language in Jelix.

This is an htmlresponse plugin.



Installation
============

Under Jelix default configuration, create an "htmlresponse" directory in your project's "plugins" directory.

Clone this repository in that directory.

Note that you should have your app plugin directory in your modulesPath (defaultconfig.ini.php or entry point's config.ini.php) to get it working.
The value should be at least :

    modulesPath="app:modules/"


This plugin needs node.js with stylus module to be installed.






Usage
=====

When including a CSS file (e.g. with addCSSLink()) you should set 'stylus'=>true as a param.

E.g. in your response :

`$this->addCSSLink($gJConfig->urlengine['basePath'].'themes/'.$gJConfig->theme.'/Css/style.styl', array( 'stylus' => true ));`

Your config file must activate stylus plugin :

    [jResponseHtml]
    plugins=stylus

N.B. : the directories containing stylus files should be writable by your web server ! Indeed, compiled files will be written in that very same directory so that relative urls go on working ...



Config
======

You can configure stylus's behviour regarding compilation:

    [jResponseHtml]
    ;...
    ; always|onchange|once
    stylus_compile=always

If stylus\_compile's value is not valid or empty, its default value is onchange.

* always : compile stylus file on all requests
* onchange : compile stylus file only if it has changed
* once : compile stylus file once and never compile it again (until compiled file is removed)



You may also set stylus modle path for node with :
`stylus_node_paths=/usr/local/lib/node_modules`

You can also set node's binary path with (default value is /usr/bin/node) :
`stylus_nodejs_bin_path=/usr/local/bin/node`


Stylus can use libraries, such as [nib](http://visionmedia.github.com/nib/). You can set a comma-separated list of those libs with :
`stylus_libs="nib"`
